# README

The basis of the application is a job board where anyone looking to get hired can come and apply for positions. If you are a user or company looking to post a job you can sign up for an account and do so for a fee. We use a combination of the Stripe API and the Stripe Ruby Gem to initialize a charge when a job gets posted.
